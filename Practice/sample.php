<!-- Here's a PHP script that merges two arrays, removes duplicate values, and sorts the resulting array in descending order:

```php -->
<?php
// Define two arrays
$array1 = array(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);
$array2 = array(30, 40, 60, 70, 80);

// Step 1: Merge the two arrays using array_merge
$mergedArray = array_merge($array1, $array2);

// Step 2: Remove duplicates using array_unique
$uniqueArray = array_unique($mergedArray);

// Step 3: Sort the array in descending order using rsort
rsort($uniqueArray);

// Print the final result
print_r($uniqueArray);
?>
```

### Explanation of the Logic and Functions Used:

1. **array_merge()**: This function is used to merge the two arrays `$array1` and `$array2` into a single array, combining all elements from both. 
   - Example:
     - `$array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
     - `$array2 = [30, 40, 60, 70, 80]`
     - After merging: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80]`
     
2. **array_unique()**: This function removes any duplicate values from the merged array, ensuring each value appears only once.
   - After removing duplicates: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`

3. **rsort()**: This function sorts the array in descending order. Unlike the usual sort function (`sort`), which sorts in ascending order, `rsort` will arrange the elements from largest to smallest.
   - After sorting in descending order: `[80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

### Output:
```php
Array
(
    [0] => 80
    [1] => 70
    [2] => 60
    [3] => 50
    [4] => 40
    [5] => 30
    [6] => 20
    [7] => 10
)
```

### Key Functions:
- **array_merge()**: Combines two or more arrays into one.
- **array_unique()**: Removes duplicate values from an array.
- **rsort()**: Sorts an array in descending order.

To model this problem, we can assume that there are a certain number of stones in the river, and each stone has a "hop time" (the time it takes for the traveler to hop to the next stone). Since the traveler can take a maximum of 5 hops, we need to calculate how many seconds it will take for the traveler to cross the river by hopping across stones, given the time for each hop.

Let's break down the steps:

### Problem Requirements:
- The traveler starts at the first stone.
- The traveler must take a maximum of 5 hops.
- Each hop takes a different amount of time (in seconds).

### Goal:
The goal is to find out the total time the traveler takes to cross the river with a maximum of 5 hops.

### Solution in PHP:
Hereâ€™s a simple PHP script that simulates the problem:

```php
<?php
// Array representing the time taken for each hop between stones
$hopTimes = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 2]; // Example hop times in seconds for each stone

// Function to calculate the total time for a crossing
function crossingTime($hopTimes, $maxHops) {
    // Initialize total time
    $totalTime = 0;
    
    // Loop through the stones (maximum of $maxHops hops)
    for ($i = 0; $i < $maxHops && $i < count($hopTimes); $i++) {
        $totalTime += $hopTimes[$i]; // Add the hop time
    }
    
    return $totalTime;
}

// Define the maximum number of hops allowed (5 hops per crossing)
$maxHops = 5;

// Calculate the time taken for the traveler to cross the river
$totalCrossingTime = crossingTime($hopTimes, $maxHops);

// Output the total time for crossing
echo "The total time taken to cross the river is: " . $totalCrossingTime . " seconds.";
?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **$hopTimes**: This array represents the time taken to hop between stones. For example, the first hop takes 2 seconds, the second takes 3 seconds, and so on. You can customize this array based on the problem scenario.
   
2. **crossingTime() function**: 
   - It takes two parameters: `$hopTimes` (the array of hop times) and `$maxHops` (the maximum number of hops allowed, which is 5).
   - The function loops through the `hopTimes` array and sums the hop times for a maximum of 5 hops, returning the total crossing time.

3. **Output**: The script calculates the total time based on the maximum allowed hops (in this case, 5) and prints the result.

### Example:
If the hop times between the stones are `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 2]`, and the traveler can take a maximum of 5 hops, the total time will be calculated as:
- 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 5 = **15 seconds**

So, the output will be:
```
The total time taken to cross the river is: 15 seconds.
```

### Customization:
- You can change the hop times or increase/decrease the number of stones by modifying the `$hopTimes` array.
- The maximum hops per crossing can be adjusted using the `$maxHops` variable.
